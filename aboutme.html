<h1>Greetings</h1>  
    
    
<p>Here is a little informaiton about me. I have extensive experience in Finance, First level technical support and customer service. My most current experience consisted of 15 years supporting clients in the Corporate Banking Treasury Management envirnment. I have due to unforseen circumstances, decided to pursue my life-long desire to pursue computer technology. Hence here I am now. I am an active thinker who loves to problem solve. My ultimate goal is to become either a web developer or an IT support Technician.</p>
